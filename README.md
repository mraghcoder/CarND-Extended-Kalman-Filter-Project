# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Problem Statement

Implement an Extended Kalman filter to track a bicycle moving around the car. Using radar and laser measurements develop a sensor fusion algorithm in C++ to track the bicycle's position and velocity.

## Algorithm flow

The tracking is achieved using an Extended Kalman filter. The main steps in programming a Kalman filter are:

1. **Initializing** Kalman filter variables
2. **Predicting** where the object is going to be after a time step Î”t
3. **Updating** where the object is based on sensor measurements

The 2 measurements - laser and radar are used to track the bicycle using a Kalman filter and Extended Kalman filter respectively. The process flow is summarized in the diagram below.

## Output

The tracking accuracy is measured using the RMSE metric for position and velocity in x and y directions.

For sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt, the RMSE values are:

| Measurement | RMSE|
| --- | --- |
| Position (x) | 0.0664081 |
| Position (y) | 0.0599689 |
| Velocity (x) | 0.505135  |
| Velocity (y) | 0.528294  |


The following is a visualization of the tracking vs the actual position of the object:

For sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-2.txt, the RMSE values are:

| Measurement | RMSE|
| --- | --- |
| Position (x) | 0.176539 |
| Position (y) | 0.187801 |
| Velocity (x) | 0.425854  |
| Velocity (y) | 0.731882  |
